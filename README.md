Web Development Assignment - ITESO
This repository contains my final individual assignment from my Web Development course at ITESO. It showcases some of my front-end capabilities, primarily for educational purposes. Please note that the payment methods included are purely illustrative and not functional.

Feel free to explore the GitHub Pages and interact with the database.

For a more comprehensive demonstration of my web development skills, including both front-end and back-end work, please check out my final project, which is available in my teammate's repository: https://github.com/LuisSantana-Repository/proyecto-web-Calendario-estudiantil-. Please note that the deployment is no longer active due to maintenance constraints.
